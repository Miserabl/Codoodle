# Codoodle
Our project for HackSC2023!

Aryan, Matt, Alejandro, Joyce

The goal of this project was to create an app that lets people connect around the world and with their friends through a medium everyone understands: doodles

We came up with the idea of having everyone draw something once a day and sharing it with all their friends, answering various prompts generated online
The goal was to have these images uploaded to a SQL database and then have users see all their friends doodles, as well as public doodles around the world.
We thought that this would be a great way to foster connections as well as gain a deeper insight into the creative minds of other people around the world
